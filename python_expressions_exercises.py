# Python Expressions Exercises (these should be practised on Python Console, but this time I'll write these into file)

# Exercise 1, There are 5280 feet in a mile. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the number of feet in 23 miles.
var = 5280 * 23
print(var)

# Exercise 2, Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the number of seconds in 10 hours, 35 minutes and 20 seconds
var = ((10*60*60)+(35*60)+24)
print(var)

# Exercise 3, The perimeter of a rectangle is 2w + 2h, where w and h are the lengths of its sides. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the length in centimeters of the perimter of a rectangle with sides of length 10 and 15 centimeters.
var = (2*10)+(2*15)
print(var)
